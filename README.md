- **Contextual Understanding**: Considers text subjectivity

### Stress Levels
The system classifies stress into three categories:
- **Low Stress** (Level 1): You are doing well
- **Moderate Stress** (Level 2): Maintain work-life balance
- **High Stress** (Level 3): Professional help recommended

### 📈 Dashboard & History
- **Unified Dashboard**: View all assessment types in one place
- **History Tracking**: SQLite database stores all assessments
- **Trend Analysis**: Track stress levels over time
- **Filter by Type**: View survey, face, or text assessments separately

### Personalized Recommendations
Each stress level includes tailored advice:
- **Low Stress**: Maintain healthy habits
- **Moderate Stress**: Engagement in physical activities, regular breaks
- **High Stress**: Sleep improvement, meditation, workload reduction, professional consultation

### Explainable AI
The results page displays the **top 3 contributing factors** to the stress prediction, helping users understand which aspects most influenced their score.

3. **Use the Application**
   - Enter your name on the welcome page
   - Choose your assessment method:
     - **Survey**: Rate 20 stress factors (1-10)
     - **Face Upload**: Upload an image for emotion analysis
     - **Live Camera**: Real-time emotion detection
     - **Text Analysis**: Write about your feelings
   - View personalized prediction and advice
   - Check your history and trends on the dashboard

## 📝 How It Works

### 1. Survey-Based Assessment
- Users rate themselves on 20 stress-related factors (1-10 scale)
- Values are scaled to match dataset feature ranges
- Random Forest model classifies stress level
- Feature importance identifies top contributing factors

### 2. Facial Emotion Detection
- CNN model (FER2013-trained) processes 48x48 grayscale images
- Detects one of 7 emotions with confidence score
- Maps emotion to stress level (e.g., Angry → High Stress)
- Works with uploaded images or live webcam feed

### 3. Text Sentiment Analysis
- TextBlob analyzes sentiment polarity (-1 to +1)
- Keyword detection identifies stress-related words
- Subjectivity score measures emotional vs factual content
- Combined analysis produces stress prediction

### 4. Advice Generation
Based on the predicted stress level, the system generates relevant recommendations tailored to the assessment method and detected factors.

### 5. History & Trends
All assessments are stored in SQLite database for tracking progress over time.

3. **Professional Help**: For high stress, consider consulting a mental health professional
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Use periodically to track stress changes

## 📌 Notes

- The stress model requires a properly formatted CSV dataset with the 20 features and a `stress_level` column
- Feature order in the application must match the dataset order
- Emotion detection requires the .h5 model files in the models/ directory
- Webcam access is required for live face detection feature
- Text analysis requires TextBlob corpora to be downloaded
- All assessment data is stored locally in SQLite database
